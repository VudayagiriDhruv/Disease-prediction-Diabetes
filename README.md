# Disease-prediction: Diabetes
•	Constructed binary regression and classification models using Python, utilising patient characteristics to predict diabetes status. 
•	Assessed the importance of each feature by removing in iterations, resulting in a 15% increase in model accuracy.
•	Explored methods such as binary regression with the odds ratio and K nearest neighbour models, comparing results to determine the most effective method. 
•	Plotted features using the Matplotlib library to visually compare impact on model performance. 
•	Implemented Pandas and NumPy libraries to develop and refine models, achieving a final model with an accuracy of 85%. 
•	Demonstrated that the performance of the model is affected by the number and type of features used.
